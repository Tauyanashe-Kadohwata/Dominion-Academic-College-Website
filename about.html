        <h1>About Our School</h1>
        <p>We are a private school which was founded and established in April of 2015 in Brakpan, South Africa by Mr Hopewell Kadohwata and Mrs Betina Kadohwata. We started of as a pre-school named Beta Child Day Care, then as the years progressed with a us receiving a high demand on establishing a primary school, we decided to expand our school and as the years approached, we added new grades into our primary school.</p>
        <p>We are a well spoken private insitution with the vision of producing great results with each and every learner, with qualified and well-motivated educators who aim at giving each and every learner equal opportunites and learning experiences. We also have the vision and mission to proceed with expanding our school and phasing in our high school in the next year or two.</p>
        <p>Our school is not only driven to achieve academic excellence only, but we also offer extra-curricular activities such as soccer, netball, chess, choir, computer lessons and many you can name.</p>
        <p>We also have fun school activities and excursions at our school to show that we learn first, and then have fun later. We go for trips to the zoo, waterparks, museums and nature reserves. We also have fun days such as Pyjama Day in winter, and Spring Day every September. We also host school concerts that showcase the impacable talents our students possess.</p>
